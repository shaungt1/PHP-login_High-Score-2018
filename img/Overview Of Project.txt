/*Developer: Shaun Pritchard
Project: Smart Login System Regitraton & Validation
Date -JAN-10-2018*/

This is a dynamic warm after I don't using PHP Vue.Js and some new CSS Frameworks.
such as bootstrap 4 and Reserve Foundation for the templates and for the responsive forms. 

This storm has 12 PHP files which allow user to login register log out view of register.
reset a password verify the password success in the password for getting passwords and 
error file to resolve any issues with the login or registration. this is a full
web application registration system.

I biult this local on MySQL and then formated it to work on on the online server provided for class.
if anyone would like to have a copy of this and extend on it please contact me.
This is a full register system it also cross examines passwrods, can reset  passwords. all passwords use 
Encrypt JS simular to how block chains technology works but for a login system.

I Will be adding google API login system to this as well.
